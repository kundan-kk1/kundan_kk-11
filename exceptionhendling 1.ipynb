    "    Exception is a Python keyword that is used to handle errors or exceptions that occur during the execution.\n",
    "of a program. It is used to catch and handle errors that may occur during the execution of a program,\n",
    "such as syntax errors, logical errors, or runtime errors.\n",
    "Syntax errors occur when a programmer writes code that is not properly structured and does not follow \n",
    "the syntax rules of the Python programming language. These errors are usually easy to identify and fix,\n",
    "but they can cause the program to fail to run.\n",
    "Logical errors occur when the code runs without any syntax errors, but the program's logic is incorrect. \n",
    "These errors can be caused by incorrect calculations, incorrect variable assignments, or incorrect data types.\n",
    "Runtime errors occur when the program runs without any syntax or logical errors, \n",
    "but the program encounters an error that occurs during runtime. \n",
    "These errors can be caused by invalid user input, file access errors, or network connection issues.\n",
    "In summary, the difference between exceptions and errors is that exceptions are used to catch and handle errors\n",
    "that occur during the execution of a program, while errors are used to indicate that something went wrong\n",
    "during the execution of a program."
