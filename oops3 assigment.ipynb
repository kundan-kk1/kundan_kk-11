    "  In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. \n",
    "    It defines the properties and methods of an object, \n",

    "    and it has its own unique state and behavior.\n",
    "For example, a class called \"Dog\" could have properties such as name, breed, and age. \n",
    "It could also have methods such as bark(), wagTail(), and eat(). \n",
    "An object of the Dog class would have its own unique name, breed, \n",
