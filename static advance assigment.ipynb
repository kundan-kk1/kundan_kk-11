    "Ans-: A probability density function (PDF) is a mathematical function used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It is a function that gives the probability that a random variable will take on a value between two limits. The PDF is non-negative everywhere, and its integral over the entire space is equal to 1."

The distribution is defined by a probability mass function (PMF), which gives the probability that the random variable takes on a particular value. Examples of discrete probability distributions include the binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, and geometric distribution.\n",
