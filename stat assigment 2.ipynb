    "The mean, median, and mode are three measures of central tendency that are used to summarize the typical value in a dataset. \n",
    "1. **Mean**:  The mean is calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and then dividing by the number of values. It is often referred to as the average. The mean is sensitive to outliers, which are extreme values that are significantly different from the rest of the data. If a dataset has a lot of outliers, the mean may not be a good measure of central tendency. \n",
    "2. **Median**: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order from smallest to largest. The median is not affected by outliers, which makes it a more robust measure of central tendency than the mean. However, the median does not provide as much information about the distribution of the data as the mean.\n",
    "3. **Mode**: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. The mode is useful for identifying the most common value in a dataset, but it is not as informative as the mean or median about the overall distribution of the data. \n",
    "The choice of which measure of central tendency to use depends on the specific dataset and the purpose of the analysis. If the dataset has a lot of outliers, the median or mode may be a better choice than the mean. If the data is skewed, the mean may not be a good measure of central tendency. In general, it is best to use all three measures of central tendency to get a complete picture of the distribution of the data."
